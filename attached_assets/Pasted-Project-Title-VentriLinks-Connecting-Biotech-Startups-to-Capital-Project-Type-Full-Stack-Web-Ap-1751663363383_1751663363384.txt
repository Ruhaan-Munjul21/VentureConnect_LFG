Project Title: VentriLinks – Connecting Biotech Startups to Capital

Project Type: Full-Stack Web App or Modern Landing Page

Description:
Build a professional, responsive, and modern website for VentriLinks, an AI-powered matchmaking platform that helps early-stage drug development startups connect with the right venture capital investors.

The site should explain what VentriLinks is, how it works, and why it's valuable — all while conveying credibility, innovation, and simplicity. This is not just a tech demo — it's a startup-grade website that could impress both investors and founders.

Bold headline (e.g., “Supercharge Your Biotech Fundraising”)

Subheadline (e.g., “AI-matched capital connections for early-stage drug development startups.”)

Primary CTA Button (e.g., “Request Early Access” or “Join Beta”)

Clean, futuristic background — think molecular structures or neural networks subtly in background
